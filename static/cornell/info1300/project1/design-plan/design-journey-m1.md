## Website Topic
> Briefly explain what your website will be about. Share your vision of your personal website. (1 sentence)
>

My website is a personal travel log where I document places I've been (or want to visit).

## Personal Website Design Exploration

Identify two personal websites (preferably static websites) that exist today on the web. You will be drawing inspiration from these sites for your own site; **please select websites that are similar to the website you wish to create**. You may not use the instructor's website or template websites for this part; the example websites should be real personal websites that exist on the web.

Include a **mobile** screenshot of the home page for each site. (If you're taking a screenshot on your laptop, resize your browser window to a mobile size before taking the screenshot.)

**We'll refer to these are your "example websites."**
